# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
Welcome to the Urban Bike Rental Prediction project repository! In response to the growing need for enhanced mobility comfort in urban cities, rental bikes have been introduced. Ensuring the availability and accessibility of these bikes at the right time is crucial, minimizing waiting times and addressing the challenge of maintaining a stable supply throughout Seoul City.

# Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to accurately predict the demand for rental bikes during different time periods and various climatic conditions in Seoul City. We employ various machine learning regression algorithms to create a robust prediction model. The objective is to forecast bike demand accurately in the near future, allowing for proactive arrangements to meet the expected demand.

# Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover hidden insights in customer behavior through EDA. This process provides a comprehensive understanding of usage patterns, contributing to informed decision-making.

Machine Learning Regression Algorithms: Implement different regression algorithms to build a predictive model. This model will play a vital role in anticipating bike demand under diverse conditions, aiding in strategic planning and resource allocation.

# Project Significance
Optimal Supply: Accurate predictions contribute to maintaining a stable supply of rental bikes, minimizing waiting times, and enhancing the overall user experience.

Proactive Planning: The predictive model allows for proactive arrangements, ensuring the city is well-prepared to meet the anticipated demand for rental bikes.

Effective Marketing Strategies: Insights derived from analysis empower targeted marketing campaigns, leading to higher engagement, deeper customer relationships, and an optimized return on marketing investment (ROI).
